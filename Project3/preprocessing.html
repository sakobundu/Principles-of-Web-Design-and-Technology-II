<h2>Different ways to implement preprocessing  (Client-side vs Server-side):</h2>

<p>Client-side prepossessing can be implemented using JavaScript, and HTML scripts. Most client interaction with a website is input and output, that where JavaScript comes in. It runs the script on the client’s system when the website is loaded. Server-side preprocessing can be implemented using backend languages such as PHP. The script is running on the server which hosts the website and sends information to the front-end through HTML code. </p>

<h2>Mechanisms used in LESS:</h2>
<h3>Mixins:</h3>
<p>Mixins are a group of CSS properties that allow you to use properties of one class for another class and includes class name as its properties. It can store multiple values and can be reused in the code whenever necessary.</p>
<h3>Variables:</h3>
<p>LESS allows variables to be defined with an @ symbol. The Variable assignment is done with a colon(:).</p>
<h3>Functions:</h3>
<p>Less provides a variety of functions which transform colors, manipulate strings and do math. Function has different types: Logical, String, List, Math, Type, Misc, Color Definition, Color Channel, Color Operation, and Color Blending. </p>
<h3>Nested variables:</h3>
<p> Nested variables are the combination of different variables in a condensed form, so it does not take up a lot of space in the  IDE.</p>
<h3>Operators:</h3>
<p> Operators in LESS can perform varieties of arithmetical operations using any number, color or variable.</p>


<!-- To implement LESS: I used a called a tool called DMXzone compiler to compile my .less files into .css files. This application offers me features to assist in my project setup  with : Full color coding, Full CSS hints support, LESS error reporting, Compile LESS files directly on save and Full LESS CSS power in Dreamweaver (Use variables, mixins, nested rules and even functions within my CSS.)-->
