<h2>Different ways to implement preprocessing  (Client-side vs Server-side):</h2>

<p>Client-side prepossessing can be implemented using JavaScript, and HTML scripts. Most client interaction with a website is input and output, that where JavaScript comes in. It runs the script on the client’s system when the website is loaded. Server-side preprocessing can be implemented using backend languages such as PHP. The script is running on the server which hosts the website and sends information to the front-end through HTML code. </p>

<h2>Mechanisms used in LESS:</h2>

<h3>Functions:</h3>
<p>Less provides a variety of functions which transform colors, manipulate strings and do math. Function has different types: Logical, String, List, Math, Type, Misc, Color Definition, Color Channel, Color Operation, and Color Blending. </p>
<h3>Nested variables:</h3>
