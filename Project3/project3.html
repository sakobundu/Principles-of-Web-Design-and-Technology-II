<h2>Importance of responsive design and its impact on the target audience:</h2>

<p>Response design is the ultimate user experience goal when it comes to web design. End-users must be able to use your website as intended after deployment.  The target audience expects all functionalities on the website that they visit to function and be compatible with the device they are using. Failure of those expectations leads to frustration. Quite frankly, a none-responsive web design is not a user-friendly website. </p>

<h2> Three different essential reports i  would like my target audience to know regarding Google Analytics:</h2>

<p> The three essential reports that will tell me the type of information that my target audience is accessing are Hours and Days Report, Content Efficiency Report, and Site Diagnostics. Hours and Days Report will inform me of when my contents attracting the users the most in terms of website traffic. Content Efficiency Report focuses on essential metrics which will help me identify which web pages are performing the best or which one needs some optimization. This would be necessary for my product-based website. Site Diagnostics exposes the challenging web pages, ones that loads slowly or crashes. Such information is essential in improving the user experience.</p>
