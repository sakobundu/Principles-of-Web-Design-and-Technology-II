<h1>Responsive Design.</h1>
<h2>Importance of responsive design and its impact on the target audience:</h2>

<p>Response design is the ultimate user experience goal when it comes to web design. End-users should be able to use your website as intended after deployment.  The target audience expects all functionalities on the website that they visit to function and be compatible with the device they are using. Failure of those expectations leads to frustration. Quite frankly, a none-responsive web design is not a user-friendly website. </p>

<h2> Three Google Analytics reports that will show targerted audiance information searches:</h2>

<p>These are Behavior Flow Report, Cohorts, and Event Tracking.The Behavior Flow report visualizes the paths users traveled from one screen, page or event to the next. This report can help you discover what content keeps users engaged with your site. A very common way to measure user engagement is through a technique called cohort analysis. A cohort is a group of users who share a common characteristic. The Cohort Analysis report lets you isolate and analyze cohort behavior.Events are commonly used in mobile apps to understand how users share content with other users, how they use the app’s search function, and when they select specific pieces of content. </p>
