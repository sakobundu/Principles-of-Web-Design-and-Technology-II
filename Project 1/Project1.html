 <h2> Describe how search engines work:</h2>
        <p> Search engines are answer machines. When a person performs an online search, the search engine scours its corpus of billions of documents and does two things: first, it returns only those results that are relevant or useful to the searcher's query; second, it ranks those results according to the popularity of the websites serving the information.</p>
        <h2>Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags:</h2>
        <p> Keywords and description as meta tags are necessary in the sense that search engines reference them when it comes to comparing if the keywords and descriptions entered are related in anyway to information in the databases. If relevant keywords and descriptions used as meta tags, the searching for information on the databases would not very user friendly and would take longer.</p>
        <h2>List the four elements that comprise writing relevant content links:</h2>
        <ul>
  <li>Links should be easy to use, navigate and under. </li>
  <li>Links should be professionally designed and accessible to modern browsers. </li>
  <li>Links should provide direct, actionable information relevant to the query.</li>
  <li>Links must deliver high quality, legitimate, credible content.</li>
</ul>  
        <h2>What constitutes good heading hierarchy and include an example with more than one heading tag:</h2>
        <p> Headers are phrases at the beginning of a section on a web page that describes what that section is about, they usually stand out from the actual information on the page. A good heading hierarchy is logically structured.  The section opening header primarily starts with (h1) and subsequent subheaders ranges from (h2 to h6). </p>
